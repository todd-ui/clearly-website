      <h2>About Co-Parenting Apps</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is a co-parenting app?</h3>
        <p>A co-parenting app is a tool designed to help separated or divorced parents coordinate their children's care. These apps typically include shared custody calendars, messaging systems, expense tracking, and documentation features — all in one place so both parents stay informed and organized.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do co-parents need an app?</h3>
        <p>Text messages and emails can get lost, misunderstood, or escalate into conflict. Co-parenting apps provide a structured, neutral space for communication that keeps the focus on the kids. They also create a record of agreements and schedules that both parents can reference — reducing confusion and "he said, she said" situations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is a co-parenting app different from texting?</h3>
        <p>Unlike texting, co-parenting apps are purpose-built for shared parenting. They organize conversations by topic, track custody schedules, calculate expense splits, and create documentation that can be referenced later. Many also include features to help keep communication civil and focused on the children.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What features should I look for in a co-parenting app?</h3>
        <p>The best co-parenting apps include: a shared custody calendar with holiday scheduling, structured communication tools, expense tracking with split calculations, schedule swap requests, calendar sync (Apple, Google), and the ability to export records. Some apps also offer AI assistance to help keep messages neutral and constructive.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">About Clearly</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What makes Clearly different from other co-parenting apps?</h3>
        <p>Clearly is built around one principle: helping conversations reach resolution. Our structured "Topics" system is inspired by the Harvard Negotiation Framework, guiding discussions toward outcomes instead of endless back-and-forth. We also use AI to help rewrite messages in a neutral tone — so your co-parent hears what you need to say, not how you're feeling in the moment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does Clearly help reduce conflict?</h3>
        <p>Clearly uses AI to transform emotionally charged messages into neutral summaries. You write what you feel, review the suggested rewrite, and send the neutral version. Your original words stay private. This helps conversations stay productive and focused on what actually matters — your kids.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can Clearly handle complex custody schedules?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Clearly supports common custody patterns (50/50, 2-2-3, every other weekend, and more) as well as fully custom schedules. Holiday custody with odd/even year rotations is built in. You can also request schedule swaps and sync everything to your phone's calendar.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does expense tracking work?</h3>
        <p>Set your expense split ratio once (50/50, 60/40, or any custom split based on your agreement). When either parent logs an expense, Clearly automatically calculates who owes what. You can attach receipts and track reimbursements — no spreadsheets required.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is Clearly available on Android?</h3>
        <p>Clearly is currently available on iOS (iPhone and iPad). Android support is on our roadmap. Sign up for our newsletter to be notified when Android launches.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I export records from Clearly?</h3>
        <p>Yes. You can export communication records, schedules, and expenses as PDF or CSV files. Exports include timestamps and are suitable for personal records or sharing with attorneys and mediators if needed.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Getting Started</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I get access to Clearly?</h3>
        <p>Clearly is currently in private beta. You can request early access through our website, and we'll reach out as spots become available. Beta users help shape the product and will be the first to experience new features.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I get my co-parent to join?</h3>
        <p>After signing up, you'll receive a Family Join Code in your settings. Share this code with your co-parent so they can connect to your shared family when they create their account. Once connected, your schedules and conversations sync automatically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How long does setup take?</h3>
        <p>Most parents complete setup in under 10 minutes. Choose from pre-loaded custody patterns or create your own, set up holidays, configure your expense split, and you're ready to go.</p>
