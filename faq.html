      <h2>About Co-Parenting Apps</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is a co-parenting app?</h3>
        <p>A co-parenting app is a tool designed to help separated or divorced parents coordinate their children's care. These apps typically include shared custody calendars, messaging systems, expense tracking, and documentation features — all in one place so both parents stay informed and organized.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do co-parents need an app?</h3>
        <p>Text messages and emails can get lost, misunderstood, or escalate into conflict. Co-parenting apps provide a structured, neutral space for communication that keeps the focus on the kids. They also create a record of agreements and schedules that both parents can reference — reducing confusion and "he said, she said" situations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How is a co-parenting app different from texting?</h3>
        <p>Unlike texting, co-parenting apps are purpose-built for shared parenting. They organize conversations, track custody schedules, calculate expense splits, and create documentation that can be referenced later. Many also include features to help keep communication civil and focused on the children.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What features should I look for in a co-parenting app?</h3>
        <p>The best co-parenting apps include: a shared custody calendar with holiday scheduling, communication tools, expense tracking with split calculations, schedule swap requests, calendar sync (Apple, Google), and the ability to export records.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can co-parenting apps help reduce conflict?</h3>
        <p>Yes. When communication is structured and documented, there's less room for misunderstandings. Shared calendars eliminate disputes over who has the kids when. Expense tracking removes arguments about money. The best apps are designed to keep conversations focused and productive.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I export records from a co-parenting app?</h3>
        <p>Most co-parenting apps allow you to export communication records, schedules, and expenses as PDF or CSV files. Exports include timestamps and are suitable for personal records or sharing with attorneys and mediators if needed.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">About Clearly</h2>
