      <h2>About Clearly</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why was Clearly built?</h3>
        <p>Clearly exists for one reason: to help co-parents focus on what matters most—their kids. We know emotions can run high, and that's okay. What matters is that both parents feel heard and that difficult conversations actually move toward resolution. We looked for an app that did this well. When we couldn't find one, we built it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Getting Started</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How easy is it to set up my custody schedule?</h3>
        <p>Super easy. We've worked hard to take the complexity out of schedule planning. Whether you have a standard 50/50, every other weekend, or a completely custom arrangement, you can set it up in minutes. Choose from common patterns or build your own, add holidays, set exchange times—and edit anytime if things change.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I invite my co-parent?</h3>
        <p>Go to Settings and find your Family Join Code. Share this code with your co-parent so they can join your family when they sign up. Once joined, you'll be connected automatically.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I change my custody schedule?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Go to Settings and select your schedule setup to modify your custody pattern, exchange times, or holiday arrangements. Changes take effect immediately.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I request a schedule swap?</h3>
        <p>Tap the swap icon on any custody day, select the dates you want to swap, and send the request. Your co-parent will receive a notification and can approve or decline.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Communication</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What are Topics and why are they important?</h3>
        <p>Topics are focused conversations about a single issue—like a schedule change, expense, or decision. Based on principles from the Harvard Negotiation Project, keeping discussions focused on one issue at a time helps move toward resolution faster. Topics prevent conversations from spiraling into unrelated grievances and make it easier to reach agreement on what actually matters.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does AI help with communication?</h3>
        <p>Clearly uses AI to help you draft topics and comments in the tone you choose—whether that's neutral, collaborative, or direct. It's completely optional, but many parents find it helpful for saying what they need to say without escalating tension. You stay in control of the message; AI just helps you find the right words.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does AI summarization work?</h3>
        <p>When you create a topic, Clearly can generate a neutral summary of your message. You review and edit before sending. Your co-parent sees the summary by default but can long tap to view your original message.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can my co-parent see my original message?</h3>
        <p>Yes, with a long tap on the summary card they can view your original message. The neutral summary is shown by default, but the original is accessible if they want to see it.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Expenses</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do expense splits work?</h3>
        <p>Set your expense split ratio during setup (e.g., 50/50 or 60/40). When you log an expense, Clearly calculates what each parent owes. Mark expenses as reimbursed to track payments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I add receipts to expenses?</h3>
        <p>Yes! When logging an expense, you can attach a photo of the receipt for your records.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Calendar & Sync</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I subscribe to my calendar?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Go to Settings → Sharing to get a calendar subscription link. Add this to Apple Calendar, Google Calendar, or any app that supports iCal feeds.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 48px;">Privacy & Security</h2>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is my data secure?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your data in transit and at rest. Your messages are only visible to you and your co-parent. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I export my data?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Go to Settings → Export Data to download your communication, expenses, or custody calendar as CSV files. This is useful for records or legal documentation.</p>
