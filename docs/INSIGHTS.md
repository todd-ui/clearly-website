# Clearly Website - Positioning & Insights

Reference document for maintaining consistency across the Clearly website.

---

## Current State: Private Beta

Clearly is in private beta. The website serves two purposes:
1. **Acquisition wedge**: Free Parenting Plan Builder (no account required)
2. **Beta access requests**: Email-based access for ongoing coordination tools

---

## Core Identity

**What Clearly is:**
- A coordination system for separated parents
- Structure for schedules, expenses, and decisions
- A way to move from circular conversations to documented agreements

**What Clearly is NOT:**
- A communication app (we're not competing with text messaging)
- A legal service or advice provider
- A behavior scoring or monitoring platform

---

## Target Audience

**Primary entry point**: Parents early in their separation journey who:
- Don't yet identify as "co-parents"
- Are exhausted by circular conversations
- Need structure before they need an app
- May be researching on behalf of themselves or as a professional referral

**Secondary**: Legal/family professionals looking for tools to recommend to clients

---

## Positioning Language

### Good framing:
- "Structure for separated parents"
- "When separation changes how you communicate"
- "A coordination system"
- "The basics: schedules, expenses, decisions"
- "Conversations that resolve"

### Avoid:
- "Co-parenting app" (too narrow, implies existing coordination)
- "Reduce conflict" (sounds adversarial)
- "Better communication" (vague, not our value prop)
- "AI-powered" (not a differentiator, sounds like hype)

---

## Homepage Arc

The homepage follows an emotional journey:

1. **Hero (Recognition)**: "You're not sure what to do next" - meet them where they are
2. **Recognition**: Validate the frustration without amplifying it
3. **Reframing**: "This isn't a communication problem" - reframe the issue
4. **Identity**: What Clearly actually does (coordination system)
5. **Starting Point**: Parenting Plan Builder as the free entry wedge
6. **How It Works**: Build → Share → Continue (optional beta)
7. **Outcomes**: Fewer surprises, less friction, decisions that stick
8. **Situations**: Micro-segmentation with relevant deep links
9. **Beta CTA**: Private access for ongoing tools

---

## Non-Negotiables (What we NEVER include)

1. **No pricing on website** - private beta, no public pricing
2. **No App Store badges/links** - beta access is email-based
3. **No testimonials or reviews** - no social proof claims
4. **No adoption numbers** - no "10,000 families" type claims
5. **No proprietary framework mentions** - no "Harvard framework" etc.
6. **No legal claims** - we don't provide legal advice
7. **No behavior scoring** - we don't judge or rank parents

---

## Free Tools

### Parenting Plan Builder
- Route: `/plan-builder/`
- No account required

## SEO Priorities

**Target keywords:**

- "co-parenting" (secondary)

**Page titles should:**
- Lead with the tool/value ("Parenting Plan Builder - Free...")

## Content Strategy
